## Intro
The repository provides two main functions:
- fucnbench

## Prombench
Benchmarking of the whole Prometheus stack and comparison with the Prometheus master branch. The benchmark is initiated by commenting on a pull request in the Prometheus repository. See Prombench [README.md](/cmd/prombench/README.md) for more information.

## Funcbench
Benchmarking of the time series database that Prometheus uses by default. The benchmark is initiated by commenting on a pull request in the Prometheus/TSDB repository. See Funcbench [README.md](/cmd/funcbench/README.md) for more information.
